# Grid-Based and Qubit-Scarce 
# Quantum Computation of Chemical Reaction Energies

- CSV files contain atom positions
- Jupyter notebooks parse CSVs into potential Hamiltonian components
- Jupyter notebooks prepare Pauli decomposition of kinetic Hamiltonian component
- A Trotterized QPE circuit is assembled with standard Qiskit operations
